A React Native Expo Restaurant Application

For this application I used React Native Expo because it was my first react native 
project, I realized this application with 5 different sections: Home, Menu, News, 
Info and Gallery, For the bottom tab navigation I used the <a href='https://reactnavigation.org/'>react-navigation</a> library.

Here is the link to download the application for android:
